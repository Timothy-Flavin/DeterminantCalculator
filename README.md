# DeterminantCalculator
1. Written during intro to java class and while taking pre-calc 
2. My math teacher said if I wrote a determinant calculator I could skip showing my work on the homework because I made the calculator function so I must know how it works.
3. Made long before I got good at java when I was first learning recursion
# Usage
Given a matrix it gives you the determinant if there is one
probably prompted to make the matrix by hand using the terminal I don't remember.
